# BotFight Evolution

![logo]

My contribution to the Creative Hack of Microsoft in January 2018, where it got the thrid place.

The idea of this project was to create a simple game which an AI is able to learn to play.

Features:
- It is somehow a game.
- 2 heuristics (randomness and good aim)
- 2 trained CNNs (one trained on randomness, one trained on the good aim)
- Includes the required python scripts to train
- Includes TensorFlowSharp to be able to use it as a standalone client
- Really ugly code (please do not judge me for that, it was a hackathon ü§∑‚Äç)

Future work:
- Better heuristics
- Train the CNN against an older self
- Better code
